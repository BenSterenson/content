The Sixgill Darkfeed™ is a stream of malicious indicators of compromise, including domains, URLs, hashes, and IP addresses.
 
It relies on Sixgill’s vast collection of deep and dark web sources, and it provides unique and advanced warnings about new cyberthreats.
 
It is automated, meaning that IOCs are extracted and delivered in real-time, and it is actionable, meaning that its consumers will be able to receive and block items that threaten their organizations.
 
Darkfeed™ and pre-built playbooks can automate your key SOC use cases such as Threat Hunting and Malware protection.
